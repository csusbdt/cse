### Advising Policy

Students meet with a faculty adviser at least once per year for the purpose of reviewing progress towards the degree and to ensure that the student's course choices allow the student to complete their degree program in a timely manner.

### Mission Statement

The mission of the Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science is to provide an exceptional undergraduate education in the discipline of computer science. The program prepares students upon graduation for immediate entry into the workforce as a software engineer, systems/network administrator, programmer or similar position, or for entry into a graduate program in computer science or a related discipline. To this end, the faculty strives to keep the program current in both the theoretical foundations and practical skills of computing. Students will graduate with immediately employable skills and a foundation for life-long learning and professional growth in a wide variety of computing professions.
