## Bachelor of Science in <strong>Computer Science</strong>

The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program emphasizes the traditional study of Computer Science, with an emphasis on mathematical rigor, theoretical foundations and computer architecture. The BS Computer Science program is accredited by [ABET][abet].

Program requirements change from year to year. Students need to complete course requirements according to the academic year they last declared their major. This information is included on the [PAWS Report][paws].

### Advising Policy

Students meet with a faculty adviser at least once per year for the purpose of reviewing progress towards the degree and to ensure that the student's course choices allow the student to complete their degree program in a timely manner.

### Mission Statement

The mission of the Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science is to provide an exceptional undergraduate education in the discipline of computer science. The program prepares students upon graduation for immediate entry into the workforce as a software engineer, systems/network administrator, programmer or similar position, or for entry into a graduate program in computer science or a related discipline. To this end, the faculty strives to keep the program current in both the theoretical foundations and practical skills of computing. Students will graduate with immediately employable skills and a foundation for life-long learning and professional growth in a wide variety of computing professions.

### Program Educational Objectives

The graduates of the Computer Systems program will have the following characteristics 3 to 5 years after graduation:

- Establish a successful career utilizing their education in Computer Science or engage in advanced studies.
- Communicate effectively in both written and oral forms across all levels of computing practice.
- Engage in life-long learning to stay current with their profession as it changes.
- Demonstrate professional competence, integrity and responsibility in diverse work environments.

### Student Learning Outcomes

By the time of graduation, student learning outcomes should include the following.

- An ability to apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline.
- An ability to analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution.
- An ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs.
- An ability to function effectively  on teams to accomplish a common goal
- An understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues and responsibilities.
- An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.
- An ability to analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society.
- Recognition of the need to and an ability to engage in continuing professional development.
- An ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice.
- An ability to apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory in the modeling and design of computer-based systems in a way that demonstrates comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in design choices.
- An ability to apply design and development principles in the construction of software systems of varying complexity.
