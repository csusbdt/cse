  <h2>Advising Policy</h2>

  <p>
    Students meet with a faculty adviser at least once per year
    for the purpose of reviewing progress towards the degree
    and to ensure that the student's course choices allow the student
    to complete their degree program in a timely manner.
  </p>

  <h2>Mission Statement</h2>

  <p>
    The mission of the Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science
    is to provide an exceptional undergraduate education in the discipline of computer science.
    The program prepares students upon graduation for immediate entry into the workforce as a software engineer,
    systems/network administrator, programmer or similar position,
    or for entry into a graduate program in computer science or a related discipline.
    To this end, the faculty strives to keep the program current in both the theoretical foundations
    and practical skills of computing.
    Students will graduate with immediately employable skills
    and a foundation for life-long learning and professional growth
    in a wide variety of computing professions.
  </p>

  <h2>Program Educational Objectives</h2>

  <p>
    The graduates of the Computer Systems program will have the following characteristics
    3 to 5 years after graduation:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Establish a successful career utilizing their education in Computer Science or engage in advanced studies.</li>
    <li>Communicate effectively in both written and oral forms across all levels of computing practice.</li>
    <li>Engage in life-long learning to stay current with their profession as it changes.</li>
    <li>Demonstrate professional competence, integrity and responsibility in diverse work environments.</li>
  </ol>
