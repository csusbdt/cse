## Master of Science in __Computer Science__

The Master of Science in Computer Science degree program provides students with academic and professional opportunities at three levels. At the first level, the program allows individuals with a baccalaureate degree in computer science (or a related field) to broaden their knowledge of the subject as well as strengthen their professional marketability and increase their earning potential. At the second level, the M.S. in Computer Science program can be an avenue for career change to computer science for those who have degrees and employment in other fields. Lastly, at the third level, the M.S. in Computer Science program provides individuals a strong foundation for graduate study at the doctoral level.

The program is designed to help students develop analytical, problem solving and practical skills in computer science through advanced course work, directed software development and supervised research and independent studies. Students should acquire sufficient and requisite knowledge in the discipline as well as critical thinking, oral and written communication skills to qualify them for highly technical positions in the industry and to enable them to be successful in a doctoral program in computer science.
