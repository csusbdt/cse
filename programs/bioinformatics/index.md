## Bachelor of Science in <strong>Bioinformatics</strong>

Bioinformatics is the interdisciplinary study of biology and biochemical systems using mathematics and computer science. It involves the use of computers and statistics to make sense out of large amounts of data that are accumulating from high-throughput biological and chemical experiments, such as sequencing of whole gnomes, DNA microarray chips, two-hybrid experiments, and tandem mass spectrometry.
The bioinformatics degree program is jointly administered by the School of Computer Science and Engineering, the Department of Biology and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.

### Program Information

- [Program Description][description]
- [Flowchart of Course Dependencies][flowchart]
- [Descriptions and Flowcharts for Prior Years][archive]

Program requirements change from year to year. Students need to complete course requirements according to the academic year they last declared their major. This information is included on the [PAWS Report][paws].

### Advising Policy

Students meet with a faculty adviser at least once per year for the purpose of reviewing progress towards the degree and to ensure that the student's course choices allow the student to complete their degree program in a timely manner.

### Mission Statement

The main goal of the bioinfrmatics degree is to prepare students for graduate studies in bioinformatics. A secondary goal is to provide students with relevant skills that will be useful for research and development in the growing biotechnology industries.
