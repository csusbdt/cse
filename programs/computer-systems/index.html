  <h2>Advising Policy</h2>

  <p>
    Students meet with a faculty adviser at least once per year
    for the purpose of reviewing progress towards the degree
    and to ensure that the student's course choices allow the student
    to complete their degree program in a timely manner.
  </p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>

  <p>
The purpose of the Bachelor of Arts degree program is
to strengthen student means to remain on a fulfilling, productive, life-long learning path
by guiding them to fundamental understanding of the structure and operation
of modern computer systems and the methods by which these systems are applied
to the solution of problems of interest to society.
The study of Computer Systems provides an ideal avenue for students
to develop intellectual skills that will make them valued by their present and future employers
and will lead them to opportunities in which they exercise their creativity and problem solving skills
to accomplish tasks that are personally fulfilling and recognized as positive contributions to society.
Faculty and staff of the School of Computer Science and Engineering
are committed to providing the best possible learning environment for students
to attain the benefits that come from mastery of this discipline.
The principal characteristic of the BA program that distinguishes it from the traditional BS program
offered by the School of Computer Science and Engineering is that it places greater emphasis on the process of problem solving
in the context that Computer Science is applied outside of the computing discipline.
To accomplish this, students take fewer units of theoretical computer science, mathematics and physics,
and increase the number of units taken in applied courses that are relevant to the student's chosen program option.
In their final year of study, students complete a senior interdisciplinary project
that solves a computing problem in their applied area of study.
  </p>

<p>
The goal of the BA Computer Systems program is for graduates of the program
to proceed to graduate study, attain industry positions in the computing field,
or engage in other satisfactory activities for which their BA Computer Systems studies have prepared them.
</p>

  <h2>Program Educational Objectives</h2>

<p>
The graduates of the Computer Systems program will have the following characteristics
3 to 5 years after graduation:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Be able to apply solve computing problems appropriate to their current work environment.</li>
<li>Communicate effectively in both written and oral forms.</li>
<li>Engage in life-long learning to stay current in their profession.</li>
<li>Demonstrate competence, integrity and responsibility in diverse work environments.</li>
</ol>
