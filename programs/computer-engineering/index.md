### Advising Policy

Students meet with a faculty adviser at least once per year for the purpose of reviewing progress towards the degree and to ensure that the student's course choices allow the student to complete their degree program in a timely manner.

### Mission Statement

The mission of the computer engineering degree program is to provide all its students with a complete foundation in the theoretical and practical underpinnings of computer engineering strengthened through hands-on learning. The program will provide students with the design, analysis, reasoning, and communication skills necessary to pursue a meaningful career in computer engineering, or related fields. Program stakeholders will foster relationships with industry to increase student learning through collaborative projects that benefit society. The program will engage students in active, fundamental and applied research that enables them to pursue advanced degrees and contribute to the growing body of computer engineering knowledge.
