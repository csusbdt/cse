## Welcome to __The School of CSE__

The School of Computer Science and Engineering educates students in the disciplines of computer science and computer Engineering, and teaches them to apply their education to solve practical problems in a socially responsible way. Preparing computer professionals for Inland Empire industries, the School of Computer Science teaches the development of software using current technology. Many disciplines involve computer technology, but what distinguishes this department is its focus on the theory, tools and techniques used to design computer systems and build application software. Students may study for the BS or MS in Computer Science, the BS in Computer Engineering, the BA in Computer Systems, or the BS in Bioinformatics.
