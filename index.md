## Welcome to __The School of CSE__

<!--
__CSE Description A__

The School of Computer Science and Engineering educates students 
in the disciplines of computer science and computer engineering, 
and teaches them to apply their education to solve practical problems 
in a socially responsible way. 
Preparing computer professionals for Inland Empire industries, 
the School of CSE teaches the development of software using current technology. 
Many disciplines involve computer technology, but what distinguishes this department 
is its focus on the theory, tools and techniques used to design computer systems 
and build application software. 
Students may study for the BS or MS in Computer Science, the BS in Computer Engineering,

__CSE Description B__
-->

The School of Computer Science and Engineering educates students in the disciplines of computing theory and machinery, and teaches them to apply their knowledge in a socially responsible way. The School educates students in the intellectual basis of the field, including issues of computability, information theory, and engineering, as well as the technology. Our graduates can design and implement the technology of computing and data communications with a deep understanding of the bases upon which these technologies rest. In addition to preparing professional workers for industry, we educate those students who wish to pursue an advanced degree or career in academic or industrial research.
Students may study for the BS or MS in Computer Science, the BS in Computer Engineering, 
the BS in Bioinformatics, or the BA in Computer Systems.
