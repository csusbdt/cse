### Microsoft Academic Alliance

If you are enrolled in a computer science course, you are eligible to obtain many
Microsoft development tools free of charge for academic use. These tools include
Visual Studio, SQL Server, Windows Server, Visio, and others. You can install these tools
on a laptop or home computer.

Complete an [MSDNAA Student Use Form][msdnaa-form] and submit it at the help desk. After the
help desk creates your account, you will be able to log into the
[MSDN Academic Alliance Software Center][msdnaa-site] and download Microsoft development tools.
